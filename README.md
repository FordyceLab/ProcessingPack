!["One Piece at a Time"](/resources/chip-working.png)

## Overview
ProcessingPack is a set of classes and functions to execute MITOMI image processing (feature finding and quantification). 

It is designed around the following paradigm:
 - Imaging of a *ChipImage* is *single* or *series*
 	- A given *ChipImage* is a 2-D array of *Stamps*
 	- A *Stamp* contains feature with attributes. Principle features are:
 		- *Chamber*: the primary reaction chamber
 		- *Button*: the contact area of the button on the slide
